> - 2025-12-01: Added `summary_level` ("short"/"detailed") behavior for section summaries.

## Section Loop Logic

For each section:

- Extract the section text.

- Summarize without adding new claims:
  - Use only information found directly in the section.
  - Do not invent background context, definitions, or results.

- Capture only:
  - The section’s purpose or main question.
  - The methods or arguments described (if any).
  - The findings, results, or conclusions stated in the text.

- Apply summary formatting based on `summary_level`:
  - **If `summary_level = "short"`:**
    - Produce a **1–2 sentence** compact summary.
    - Do **not** include bullet points or extra formatting.
  - **If `summary_level = "detailed"`:**
    - Produce a **short paragraph** (3–5 sentences) summarizing the section.
    - Then provide a **bullet list of 3–5 key points** capturing important facts, equations, definitions, or results from the section text.

- Preserve original section order when outputting summaries.

- Generate both expert and lay transformations:
  - Produce one expert-oriented summary and one layperson-friendly version,
  - Each must follow the selected `summary_level` format.

- Provide hooks for Module 03 guardrails:
  - Pass section text and length so Module 03 can enforce:
    - `evidence_mode` (e.g., strict evidence rules),
    - warnings for missing or very short sections.
