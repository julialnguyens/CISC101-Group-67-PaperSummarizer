> - 2025-12-01: Added `evidence_mode = "strict"` and warnings for missing/short sections.
Detect missing, empty, or <50-word sections.

- If a section is missing or empty, do not summarize it.  
  Output: `Section skipped: no usable text was provided for this section.`
- If a section is very short (< 50 words), still summarize it but add a warning.  
  Output: `Section very short: summary may be incomplete.`

Support evidence modes.

- `evidence_mode = "default"` → normal behavior (still avoid obvious hallucinations).
- `evidence_mode = "strict"` → only use information that appears directly in the section text.
  - Do not add background knowledge, definitions, or assumptions.
  - If there is not enough information to summarize, output:  
    `The source text does not provide enough detail to summarize this section in strict evidence mode.`

Prevent hallucinations.

- Never guess or fill in missing results.
- Only restate what the section actually says.

Enforce evidence-based constraints from PS2.

- All summaries must be grounded strictly in the provided paper text.
- In `evidence_mode = "strict"`, be extra conservative and avoid any speculative phrasing.

Manage long-paper chunking (context-window).

- When the paper is chunked, treat each chunk as the only source of truth for that part.
- Do not bring in information from other chunks unless it is clearly in context.

Ensure:

- No fabricated claims  
- No invented sections  
- Every statement traceable to paper text
