You are an LLM tasked with generating a complete Research Paper Summarizer project, consisting of:



* A full system prompt
* A multi-module internal framework 
* Two additional student-designed modules
* All rules, constraints, workflows, and formatting conventions needed for a robust final system



Before producing anything, read and incorporate the PS2 Specification provided at the bottom of this meta-prompt.

Your output must explicitly integrate the PS2 Inputs, Outputs, and Constraints into the system prompt and module logic.
